# Networking-Project-GNS3
The imaginary company is called Smart choices Technology, they provide the development of small and medium IT projects, such as developing desktop applications, building websites and databases. The company started as a startup, thus they do not have more than 50 employees at the moment, but in the future the network should be extendable in case of new buildings and new workers. Currently the company owns two buildings, one for the developer and management team, and one for the office where clients can come in to and place their order or discuss their problems.  The office building is also the home of the HR and Sales department. The company separates the departments with the help of VLANs. This is because of security purposes (regarding the unwanted traffic), and because of the usage of DHCP. In case of new employees, the departments can be extended easily and hosts can receive the appropriate IP address.
